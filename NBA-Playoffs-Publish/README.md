## NBA Team Performance and Sponsor Stock Price Analysis

In the 2017â€“18 NBA season, the NBA introduced the opportunity for teams to sell sponsorships displayed on the front left shoulder of player uniforms. In this project, I examine the relationship between NBA team performance and the success of their sponsors. Specifically, I explore the change in stock price of publicly traded sponsors between the NBA team's playoff gameday and the day after.

### Key Insights:
- A loss by the team negatively impacts the sponsor's stock price, while a win has a small positive effect.
- A loss by a favorite team leads to a more significant drop in the sponsor's stock price.
- No clear trend emerges as teams advance through the playoffs.
- The absolute price response remains consistent as the series progresses, except for Game 7.
- The absolute price response is larger in the final game of the series, regardless of win or loss.
- The stock price response peaks at typical start times for Eastern Conference games, reflecting that sponsors in the data are mainly from Eastern exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, TSX).
- The tech-focused NASDAQ exchange shows the most responsive stock price changes.
